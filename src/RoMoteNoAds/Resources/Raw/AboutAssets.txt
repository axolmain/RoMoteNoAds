Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories). Deployment of the asset to your application
is automatic. You can reference the raw asset in your application by path.

For example, you can access the asset in this directory with:
    var file = await FileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync("AboutAssets.txt");
